search text for your name
/*jshint multistr:true */
var text = "blah Mike blah blah \
blah blah Mike blah";
var myName ="Mike";
var hits =[];

for (var i=0;i<text.length;i++){
    if (text[i]===myName[0]){
        for (var j=i;j<myName.length+i;j++){
            hits.push(text[j]);
        };
        
    };
};
if (hits.length === 0){
    console.log("Your name wasn't found!");
    }
    else {
        console.log(hits);
    }
    

Now, as we mentioned, this system isn't perfect. For instance, if the paragraph contains both "Eric" and "Eddie", we'll see this in our hits array:

['E','r','i','c','E','d','d','i','e'];
Think about how you might fine-tune this program to make sure it only finds exact matches for your name. Search the Internet to see if there are any built-in JavaScript string methods that can help!
